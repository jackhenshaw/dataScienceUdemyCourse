## Highlight
[10_tensorflow_project.ipynb](https://github.com/jackhenshaw/dataScienceUdemyCourse/blob/main/10_tensorflow_project.ipynb) showcases the majority of the skills learned in the course as a whole including the exploratory data analysis, handling missing data, and feature engineering, followed by building and testing machine learning models to see, in this case, whether or not someone should be granted a financial loan. 

## Description
Repo showcasing the skills learned during the above mentioned data science course hosted on udemy. 

The course covered data visualisation using libraries such as matplotlib, seaborn, plotly and cufflinks. 
All of which are showcased throughout each project in the exploratory data analysis.
Various machine learning models using supervised and unsupervised learning are tested based on the data being analysed and the desired behaviour of the outcome.

## Algorithms/libraries explored include:
- matplotlib, seaborn, plotly and cufflinks
- Linear and logisitc regression
- Decision trees and random forests
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- K means clustering
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- deep learning for regression and classification with Keras and Tensorflow
- AWS and Spark
